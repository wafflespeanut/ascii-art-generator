## ascii-art-generator

> **NOTE:** This is a port of my [Python project](https://github.com/wafflespeanut/ascii-art-generator/tree/0b519b00b43eadb8500db30c304b2b87ad7eb159) to play with Rust and WASM.

Generates ASCII arts from JPEG/PNG images. [Live demo](https://waffles.space/ascii-gen/).

### Usage

```
make prepare    # install rustfmt, wasm-pack, npm deps, etc.
make run
```

Then, visit `localhost:3000` in your browser.

### How it works?

[I've blogged about it](https://blog.waffles.space/2017/03/01/ascii-sketch/).
